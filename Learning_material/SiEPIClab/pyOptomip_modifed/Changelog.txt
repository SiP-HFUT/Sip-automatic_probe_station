Version 1.1 - Stephen
Changes: FineAlign.py, hp816x_instr.py
Legend: ! New, @Fixes, #Changes, **Note

==FineAlign.py==
!FineGradientSearch
New gradient search introduced that runs the search a second time at 0.5 micron step sizes. 
This is performed after the rough gradient search has found its result

!useDebugStep
-Togglable Debug feature added, outputs individual step data allowing for analyzing

!UltraFineAlign
-New togglable option: sets the laser(hp816x_instr)'s averaging time to longer, increases accuracy of detection.
-Currently set to 0.01 seconds.

!Laser Averaging Time
-Originally did not specify this time.
-Fixed to default to 0.0001 seconds unless UltraFineAlign is turned on.
**Does not set this value until Finealign is used. For future: should be ran on pyOptomip startup.

#GradientSearch
-Original gradient search is now known as "roughGradientsearch"


==hp816x_instr.py==
@setPWMAveragingTime
-fixed a typo preventing this function from running.
(channel parameter was labeled as "channel" while the code used "chan")
